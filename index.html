    Call me a wanderer for now.  For the summer, I've landed in Chicago, IL, as a
    <a title="DSSG" href="http://dssg.io" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a>.
    I have no idea where I'll be next, though I'm considering a cycling trip across North America.

    <p>
    In the last few years, I've been several different places.  For the most part, I've been a college student: I'm
    graduating in May, 2014, from
    <a title="Oberlin College" href="https://home.oberlin.edu" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a>
    with a B.A. in Mathematics, though much of my coursework was in computer science.  When I wasn't in class, I worked
    for the Democratic National Committee during the 2012 elections as a software engineer, served as operations manager
    for the Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, worked as a research assistant at a computer security lab in
    Oberlin, and attempted and failed, (for now,) at starting a software engineering cooperative to build software for
    small-scale community organizations.

    <p>
    I'm interested in politics, political economics, and human geography, programming languages and compiler design,
    sustainability, feminism, philosophy, religion.  I've done some technical work, and much of it is open source.  You
    can check it out on
    <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com/ihmccreery/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
